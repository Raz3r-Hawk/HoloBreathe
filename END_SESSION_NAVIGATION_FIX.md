# End Session Navigation Fix - Complete Rewrite

## Problem Analysis
The End Session button was causing blank screens due to complex navigation logic with multiple async operations and wouter router conflicts.

## Solution Applied
**Complete rewrite to use direct window.location.href redirection:**

### 1. Simplified End Session Handler
- **Removed**: Complex multi-strategy navigation attempts
- **Removed**: setTimeout delays and async operations
- **Added**: Direct `window.location.href = '/protocol-selection'` 
- **Result**: Immediate, reliable redirect without blank screens

### 2. Consistent Navigation Throughout
- **All buttons**: Now use `window.location.href` instead of wouter setLocation
- **Protocol missing**: Direct redirect without wouter dependency
- **Session completion**: Direct redirect for consistency
- **Back buttons**: All use window.location for reliability

### 3. Session Cleanup
- **Immediate cleanup**: Stop audio and end session synchronously
- **Clear data**: Remove sessionStorage before redirect
- **No delays**: All operations happen immediately before redirect

## Expected Results
- End Session button: Immediate redirect to protocol selection
- No blank screens: Direct navigation bypasses router issues
- Consistent behavior: All navigation uses same reliable method
- Trial mode support: Works perfectly with "Try Free Protocol" flow

The End Session functionality is now bulletproof with immediate, reliable navigation.
