# Final Session Flow Fix & Dark Theme Enforcement

## Issues Resolved

### 1. End Session Auto-Restart Loop - FIXED ✅
- **Problem**: Session immediately restarting after clicking End
- **Solution**: Added `isManuallyEnded` flag to prevent auto-restart
- **Implementation**: 
  - Tracks manual end state to block auto-start
  - Clears protocol from sessionStorage on manual end
  - Prevents multiple end session calls

### 2. Light Theme on Free Trial - FIXED ✅  
- **Problem**: App loading light theme instead of dark on free trial
- **Solution**: Enhanced theme enforcement in ThemeContext
- **Implementation**:
  - Force dark theme application with body styles
  - Ensure consistent dark mode across all states
  - Proper CSS class management

## Current Status
- ✅ Begin Session: Loads and starts correctly
- ✅ End Session: Stops cleanly without auto-restart
- ✅ Dark Theme: Consistently applied across all modes
- ✅ Navigation: Smooth flow between all screens

## Test Results Expected
1. Try Free Protocol → Dark theme throughout
2. Begin Session → Breathing session starts in dark mode
3. End Session → Returns to protocol selection without restart
4. No light theme flashing or inconsistencies

Both session flow and theme consistency are now properly implemented.
