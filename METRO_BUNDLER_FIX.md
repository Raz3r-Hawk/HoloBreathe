# Metro Bundler Configuration Fixed

## Issue Resolved
React Native Metro bundler errors caused by ES module conflicts and configuration mismatches have been fixed.

## Applied Fixes
- Renamed configuration files to `.cjs` extension for CommonJS compatibility
- Updated Metro resolver with proper alias configuration
- Added platform-specific source extensions
- Enhanced transformer options for compatibility
- Cleared Metro cache to remove stale configurations

## Configuration Changes
- `react-native.config.js` → `react-native.config.cjs`
- `metro.config.js` → `metro.config.cjs`  
- Added proper source extensions: js, jsx, ts, tsx, json
- Configured platform support: android, ios, native, web

## Ready for Development
The Metro bundler is now properly configured and should start without errors. Your breathing app can be developed and tested on Android devices.
