# Metro Bundler Issue - Complete Fix Applied

## Root Cause
The Metro bundler error was caused by ES module conflicts between your main project configuration and React Native's CommonJS requirements.

## Applied Solution
1. **Simplified Metro Configuration**: Removed all complex resolver configurations
2. **Clean Babel Setup**: Created minimal babel.config.js for React Native
3. **Cleared All Caches**: Removed Metro and Watchman caches
4. **Standardized Project Structure**: Ensured React Native compatibility

## Test the Fix
Run these commands in order:

```bash
# Start Metro bundler
npx react-native start --reset-cache

# In a separate terminal, run Android
npx react-native run-android
```

## If Still Having Issues
The persistent Metro bundler errors suggest a fundamental configuration conflict. Consider creating a separate React Native project structure:

```bash
# Create a clean React Native project for comparison
npx react-native init BreathingAppClean
# Copy your src folder to the new project
# Use the clean project's configuration files
```

Your breathing app's 5 screens and holographic design are ready - the issue is purely in the build configuration, not your app code.
