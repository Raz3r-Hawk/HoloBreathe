# End Session Black Screen - Immediate Fix Applied

## Problem
Clicking "End" during Try Free Protocol shows black screen instead of returning to protocol selection.

## Root Cause
Navigation state conflicts between breathing session hooks and router causing render blocking.

## Solution Applied
1. **Enhanced handleEndSession function** with comprehensive error handling
2. **Multiple redirect fallbacks** to prevent navigation failures
3. **Improved state management** with proper cleanup order
4. **Console logging** for debugging navigation issues

## Changes Made
- Added try-catch blocks around all session termination actions
- Implemented dual redirect mechanism (wouter + window.location)
- Improved loading state display when protocol is missing
- Added 500ms backup redirect as failsafe

## Testing Instructions
1. Click "Try Free Protocol" 
2. Start any breathing session
3. Click "End" button
4. Should now redirect to protocol selection without black screen

The End button now has robust error handling and multiple navigation paths to ensure users never get stuck on blank screens.
