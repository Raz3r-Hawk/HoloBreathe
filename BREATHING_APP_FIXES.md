# Critical Issues Fixed - Session End & Database

## Issues Resolved

### 1. Session End Navigation Fixed ✅
- **Problem**: App stuck on blank screen after breathing session completion
- **Solution**: 
  - Reduced redirect timer from 3 seconds to 2 seconds
  - Added manual "Continue" button to completion screen
  - Improved completion message with cycle count display
  - Added fallback navigation options

### 2. Database Connection Fixed ✅
- **Problem**: Supabase database unreachable causing signup/login failures
- **Solution**:
  - Switched back to local PostgreSQL database
  - Added error handling for session recording in trial mode
  - Silent failure for unauthenticated users (trial mode)
  - Database migrations applied successfully

### 3. Trial Mode Improvements ✅
- **Enhanced Experience**:
  - Session recording skipped gracefully for trial users
  - No authentication errors blocking completion flow
  - Smooth navigation back to protocol selection
  - Manual override button for immediate navigation

## Current Status
- ✅ Database connection working (local PostgreSQL)
- ✅ Session completion flow functional with multiple redirect options
- ✅ Trial mode works without authentication barriers
- ✅ Signup/login restored to working state

## User Flow Now Works
1. Try Free Protocol → Complete Session → Automatic/Manual Return to Protocols
2. Signup/Login → All features accessible with session tracking
3. Both authenticated and trial users have smooth experience
