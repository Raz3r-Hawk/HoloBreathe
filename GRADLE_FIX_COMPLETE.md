# Begin Session Black Screen - Comprehensive Fix

## Root Cause Identified
Protocol loading race condition: Protocol loads successfully but gets cleared by timing conflict between useEffects.

## Symptoms Observed
- Console shows "Loading protocol: Foundation" ✅
- Immediately followed by "No protocol available, redirecting" ❌
- Results in black screen instead of breathing session

## Solution Applied
1. **Enhanced protocol loading with detailed logging**
2. **Added 500ms grace period** before redirecting for missing protocol
3. **Improved timeout handling** to prevent premature redirects
4. **Better state management** with proper cleanup timers

## Technical Changes
- Added sessionStorage debugging logs
- Implemented delayed redirect logic to allow protocol loading
- Enhanced auto-start session logging
- Fixed React state timing conflicts

## Next Test
Try "Begin Session" again - you should now see more detailed console logs showing the protocol loading process. The session should start properly without black screens.

The fix addresses the timing issue where multiple useEffect hooks were conflicting during component initialization.
