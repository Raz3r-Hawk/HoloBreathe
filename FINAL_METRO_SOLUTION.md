# Metro Bundler - RESOLVED Successfully

## Complete Fix Implemented ✅
The persistent Metro bundler errors have been completely resolved through:

1. **Configuration Files**: Renamed to `.cjs` extensions for CommonJS compatibility
2. **Missing Dependencies**: Installed required `@react-native/metro-config` packages  
3. **Clean Configuration**: Used standard Metro configuration template
4. **Cache Clearing**: Removed all conflicting cache files

## Files Updated
- `react-native.config.js` → `react-native.config.cjs`
- `metro.config.js` → `metro.config.cjs`  
- `babel.config.js` → `babel.config.cjs`
- Added Metro dependencies: `@react-native/metro-config`, `metro`, `metro-resolver`

## Status: WORKING ✅
Metro bundler now starts successfully and displays the React Native logo without errors.

## Ready for Android Development
Your breathing app can now be developed and deployed:

```bash
# Start Metro bundler
npx react-native start --reset-cache

# Run on Android device/emulator
npx react-native run-android
```

The holographic breathing interface with all 5 screens is ready for immediate Android deployment and APK generation.
